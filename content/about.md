## Hey, I'm Myat Min Khant ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Myat Min Khant**, a final-year **Cyber Security and Forensic** student at the **University of Computer Studies, Yangon**.

Currently, I'm working as a **SOC Analyst** at **Kernellix**, where I deal with real-world threats and security monitoring on a daily basis.

Iâ€™m passionate about all things cybersecurity â€” especially **Reverse Engineering**, **Web Security**, and **Digital Forensics**. I actively participate in **CTFs** and enjoy solving challenging problems that require both technical skills and creativity.

If youâ€™ve made it to my blog, I hope something here interests or inspires you. Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out â€” Iâ€™m always up for a good conversation on cyber stuff!
