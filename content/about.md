## Hey, I'm Myat Min Khant 👋


I'm Myat Min Khant, a graduate in Cyber Security and Forensics from the University of Computer Studies, Yangon (UCSY).

I’m deeply interested in Malware Analysis and Reverse Engineering. I enjoy understanding how malware works at a low level, breaking down binaries, and analyzing techniques used by attackers — with the goal of improving detection and defense.

I actively participate in CTFs and like solving challenges that require strong analytical thinking, low-level knowledge, and creativity.

If you’ve made it to my blog, I hope something here interests or inspires you. Don’t hesitate to reach out — I’m always up for a good conversation about cybersecurity, malware, or reversing.

> <----- Yep, you found this little corner. Glad you're here!

Hope you enjoy reading, and have an awesome day!
